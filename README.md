# Library API 

This repository contains the source code for the Project library-api, a web application built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Introduction
The Library API is a comprehensive web application that empowers developers with a multitude of book and author-centric functionality. Leveraging this API, developers gain the ability to search for books and access detailed information about specific titles. Furthermore, the API allows developers to retrieve insightful details about authors. With easy-to-use endpoints and methods, developers can easily interact with the library's database, making it easy to integrate these exceptional features into their own applications. The Library API leverages the Node.js runtime environment, employs the Express framework for robust web application development, and uses MongoDB as the database, ensuring a reliable and scalable foundation for an immersive library experience.
